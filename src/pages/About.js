        TheCocktailDB is built in 2020 to provide a free data source for drinks.
        A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a combination of
        spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients such as
        fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are various types of
        cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added. The
        origins of the word cocktail have been debated. It is developed and
        maintained by Manish Raj
